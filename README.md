The Github Page for JooMoo WebSites LLC.

### Page Setup

I used the Github Pages automatic generator to create this page.

### Editing the Page Manually

It appears that you could probably edit the markdown for index.html someplace, but I did not find anything about that right away.

Being totally comfortable with editing HTML (in vi when possible, thankyouverymuch) I have decided to just edit index.html manually.

I suppose finding and editing the markdown for this page, if indeed that is possible, could possibly overwrite what I have done, so be careful about that.
