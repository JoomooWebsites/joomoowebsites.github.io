          <h3>Device Detection Use Cases</h3>
          <p>
           Here are some use cases for Device Detection:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If you have an app specific Android or iPhones, serve a link to get the correct app</li>
            <li>
              Detect which version of android they are using</li>
            <li>
              Ads: web server uses ad server</li>
            <li>
              Images (e.g. banners vs. portrait vs. none - for site headings)</li>
            <li>
              Download page: </li>
            <li>
              Nike id (look up) flash widget to customize shoes, use html5 on iPhones</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Also: mobile bloat is a thing; do people know that device detection packages are available?</p>
          <p>
            TODO: write pitches for these use cases!</p>

          <h3>Wanted: Use Cases for Device Detection in LAMP CMSes</h3>
          <p>
            I spent quite a bit of time recently integrating
            <a href="https://tomwhartung.github.io/ress/" target="_blank"
               title="LAMP CMS Customizations page at tomwhartung.github.io">
              device detection with LAMP CMSes</a>.
            </p>
          <p>
            I did this mainly out of curiosity, but feel strongly that this work could and should be useful to someone &mdash;
            that it could really help solve a specific business case.</p>
          <p>
            If you or someone you know is interested in learning how their LAMP CMS can be enhanced to
            customize as much or as little of the content it serves to specific types of devices, please

          <h3>Why "JooMoo?"</h3>
          <p>
            At one point I found a job working for a company that wanted to pay everyone by 1099 instead of W-2.
            To facilitate this, they had an accountant who created an LLC for each employee that didn't have one already.</p>
          <p>
            The job entailed working with
            <a href="https://www.joomla.org/" title="Joomla.org home page" target="_blank">Joomla</a>
            and
            <a href="http://mootools.net/" title="Mootools.net home page" target="_blank">Mootools</a>,
            and I wanted them to think they'd picked the right guy.
            So after due consideration over the period of a few days, I decided to go with "JooMoo,"
            because it has the side benefit of being fun to say.</p>
          <p>
            Since that time I have continued to work with Joomla and
            <a href="http://php.net/" title="php.net home page" target="_blank">PHP</a>,
            and have also gained some exposure to open source tools like
            <a href="https://www.wordpress.org/" title="WordPress.org home page" target="_blank">WordPress</a>,
            <a href="https://www.drupal.org/" title="Drupal.org home page" target="_blank">Drupal</a>,
            <a href="http://jquery.com/" title="jQuery.com home page" target="_blank">jQuery</a>,
            <a href="http://jqueryMobile.com/" title="jQueryMobile.com home page" target="_blank">jQueryMobile</a>,
            and languages such as
            <a href="http://python.org/" title="Python.org home page" target="_blank">Python</a>,
            <a href="http://javaScript.com/" title="JavaScript.com home page" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>,
            and have even gotten some paid experience working with
            <a href="http://java.com/" title="Java.com home page" target="_blank">Java</a>.</p>
          <h3>And the "WebSites" Part?</h3>
          <p>
            They seem to be popular, but my skills and interests are not limited to the internet.&nbsp;&#9786;</p>
          <p>
            Silliness aside, although I can create basic, functional websites using a variety of tools,
            I like sites that are minimal and simple, and
            moreover am more comfortable doing backend back than working on the UI.</p>
